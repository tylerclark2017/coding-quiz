# coding-quiz



## Project Explanation
This project is meant to teach us how to use JavaScript and jQuery to create a coding quiz. This project forces us to use what we learned throughout the week.

## Disclosures
I did use the Xpert Learning Assistant to help guide me in this process, ensuring that the code I used was accurate. It helped me create most of my functions and some of the CSS styles.
